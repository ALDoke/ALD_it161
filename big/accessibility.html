       <h2 class="subheader">Accessability</h2>
           <p>The point of most websites and the internet is to be a place of accessibility to information at record speeds on just about any topic. A good example of this type of information sharing is through wikipedia, as it is fully supported by its users rather than a corporation or company. In order for this information to be fully accessible though is to allow access not just via sharing information but the method it is done as well. This is what brings up the point of accessibility options in the creation of websites to allow for anyone to be able to have access despite any inconveniences of technology or disability. The W3 says that ”When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.” Open source programs allow for accessibility for the authors of web pages, so that should be passed on to the viewers as well. HTML5 allows for the input of different tags that will translate into visual effects such as bold or italics, but are much more important and usable than just a visual perspective. These tags: "strong" and "em", are the most basic example of translating a purely visual media into  something that can be accessed by the visually impared through the use of screen readers. Other similar tactics include adding descriptions to images and links on your web pages so that they can be assessed via a screen reader similarly. In addition to applying accessibility options to websites for the sake of others, there has been legal action put into place with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as seen in the discussion by (RS)Websols on why companies must be adhering to these accessibility measures. Extensive action has been put into place to allow for the internet to become as accessible with the implementing of the ADA. </p>
